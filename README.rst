About mvptree
-------------

The MVP tree is a distance-based data structure for the storage and retrieval of
n-dimensional datapoints.  It relies on the relative distances from selected vantage 
points to index the points into a tree-like hierarchy. It thus cuts the search space 
into distinct 'hyper-spheres' around each vantage point.  

`mvptree` is licensed under GPLv3.
